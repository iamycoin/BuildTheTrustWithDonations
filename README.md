First of all because I do not want to reveal my identity and as well it is a bit imposible to make anyone to trust in my project under my pseudo name <b>IAM by Satoshi Nakamoto</b> which unfortunately is taken from a real connection with <b>Mr Satoshi Nakamoto</b> I will try to make this <b>Crypto currency forked from BTC Source Code</b> to be genuine and anyone to trust in it even if still nobody met yet me or the Bitcoin father's Satoshi Nakamoto.

So in order to trust you must believe in this Crypto is not managed by stupids or by people with bad intentions or by people who nobody trust in them, like me a noname but with good intentions. I was thinking since I was started this project how to involve people in this project without to create obligations from both sides, and I found a solution which in my oppinion is fair:

<b><i>To donate most of coins mined till now by me to known trusted people what are recognized for their performance by anyone from this planet! At this moment I have mined +9 mil Coins which means more than 25% from 28 mil Coins what are available to be mined. I am happy to remain with 10% from the total mined Coins and to make donations to next people and companies:</b></i>
